## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in the E programming language or its associated libraries, please report it responsibly.

### How to Report

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please:

1. **Email**: Send details to [INSERT SECURITY EMAIL]
2. **Subject**: Use "SECURITY: [Brief Description]" as the subject line
3. **Include**:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours
- **Investigation**: We will investigate and respond within 7 days
- **Updates**: We will provide regular updates on our progress
- **Resolution**: We will work with you to resolve the issue

### Responsible Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure practices:

1. **Confidentiality**: We will keep your report confidential until we have a fix
2. **Timeline**: We will work to resolve critical issues within 30 days
3. **Credit**: We will credit you in our security advisories (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)
4. **Coordination**: We will coordinate with you on the disclosure timeline

## Security Considerations

### ARM64 Assembly Security

When contributing to this project, please consider:

- **Buffer Overflows**: Ensure all memory operations are bounds-checked
- **Integer Overflows**: Validate arithmetic operations
- **Register Usage**: Follow ARM64 calling conventions to prevent stack corruption
- **Memory Safety**: Use compiler-enforced safety rules where possible

### Code Review Process

All contributions undergo security review:

- **Static Analysis**: Automated checks for common vulnerabilities
- **Manual Review**: Human review of security-critical code
- **Testing**: Security-focused testing on multiple ARM64 platforms

### Known Security Features

The E language is designed with security in mind:

- **Memory Safety**: Compiler-enforced rules prevent common memory errors
- **No Runtime Dependencies**: Reduces attack surface
- **ARM64 Native**: Leverages hardware security features
- **Modular Design**: Minimal feature set reduces complexity

## Security Best Practices

### For Contributors

- **Input Validation**: Always validate inputs to functions
- **Bounds Checking**: Ensure array and buffer access is safe
- **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling
- **Documentation**: Document security considerations in code

### For Users

- **Keep Updated**: Use the latest version of the language
- **Review Code**: Review any code you include in your projects
- **Test Thoroughly**: Test your applications for security issues
- **Follow Guidelines**: Follow ARM64 security best practices

## Security Advisories

Security advisories will be published:

- **GitHub Security Advisories**: For critical issues
- **Release Notes**: For all security updates
- **Documentation**: Updated security guidelines

## Contact

For security-related questions or concerns:

- **Email**: [INSERT SECURITY EMAIL]
- **Issues**: Use private security issues (when available)
- **Discussions**: Use GitHub Discussions for general security questions

## Acknowledgments

We thank the security researchers and community members who help keep E secure through responsible disclosure and security-focused contributions.
